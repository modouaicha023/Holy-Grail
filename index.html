                    <p>
                        Alright, let's throw some good 'ole Lorem Ipsum to finish this article off.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
                        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
                        when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
                        specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
                        electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in
                        the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
                        and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
                        including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Why do we use it?</h3>
                    <p>
                        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable
                        content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum
                        is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to
                        using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many
                        desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their
                        default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites
                        still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years,
                        sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
                    </p>
                    <h3>Where does it come from?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has
                        roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000
                        years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in
                        Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a
                        Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical
                        literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections
                        1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good
                        and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory
                        of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum,
                        "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for
                        those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et
                        Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form,
                        accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Where can I get some?</h3>
                    <p>
                        There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the
                        majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or
                        randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going
                        to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything
                        embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on
                        the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the
                        first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin
                        words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem
                        Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always
                        free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
